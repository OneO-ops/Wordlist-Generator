# Wordlist Generator
Python Wordlist Generator created without librarys(almost)

I try to further develop and optimize the code in my free time.
The main goal of this code, as mentioned, is to write code as pure as possible (without using external libraries or functions).
The main challenges are that combinations, without a library or ready-made functions, are quite tedious to handle, and that variables such as j1, j2, j3, which are selected from the list, need to be chosen separately for each situation (although this makes the code longer, it runs more efficiently during execution).
If you notice any errors or have any suggestions, please feel free to contact me at "efemelis12@gmail.com".
